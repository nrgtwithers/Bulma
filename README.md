# Bulma

## Overview

This site is based upon utilizing **Bulma Framework** to create an optional layout for one of my client's Photography Portfolio site.

## Advantages

1. The simplest grid system (Just add columns, they will resize themselves). 
1. No Javascript is required (CSS only so it integrates in any JS environment)
1. 100% Reponsive (Designed for Mobile First)
1. Clear Syntax by using the is- for the classesâ€™ names.

## Disadvantages

1. Fairly new, not as large of a community.
1. Relatively weak documentation and could use some minor improvement.

### Technologies Utilized
- HTML5
- CS3
